# Community Library Tracker
[View Live](http://tnharvey.github.io/library/)

Project completed as part of The Odin Project. Requirements were to build a simple system to track entries/records of books in a library and whether or not they have been read.
Built using Firebase to allow all users to see all entries with instant updates.
